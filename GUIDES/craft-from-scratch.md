# Start a Craft CMS 4 project from scratch

Run `composer create-project heyblackmagic/foundation ./PATH` to create your Craft CMS instance.

This command will install Craft CMS with the base setup for Laravel Mix project development. 

The CLI will prompt you with the information required to complete the installation. This process is similar to the standard Craft CMS installation command.
